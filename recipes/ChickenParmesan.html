    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan, also known as Chicken Parmigiana, is a beloved Italian-American dish that features breaded chicken breast cutlets topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. The preparation begins by coating the chicken breasts in flour, then dipping them in beaten eggs, and finally covering them with seasoned breadcrumbs. The breaded chicken is then pan-fried until golden and crispy. After frying, the chicken cutlets are placed in a baking dish, smothered in marinara sauce, and generously topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <p>The dish is then baked until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. This process ensures that the chicken remains moist on the inside while achieving a crispy exterior. Chicken Parmesan is often served with pasta, making it a hearty and comforting meal that is perfect for family dinners. The combination of crispy chicken, savory marinara sauce, and melted cheese creates a dish that is rich in flavor and satisfying to eat</p>
