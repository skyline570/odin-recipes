    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>Hot and sour soup is a flavorful Chinese soup known for its balanced mix of spicy, tangy, and savory flavors. The key ingredients include mushrooms, tofu, and bamboo shoots, all simmered in a broth that is both spicy and sour, thanks to the addition of rice vinegar and chili garlic sauce. This soup is often enjoyed as a starter in Chinese cuisine and is loved for its complex taste and comforting warmth.</p>

    <p>This soup is thickened with cornstarch, which gives it a slightly viscous texture that helps to carry the flavors of the broth. The addition of beaten egg adds a silky texture and protein, making it a wholesome dish. Green onions and optional fresh cilantro provide a fresh contrast to the rich, hearty soup. Hot and sour soup is not only delicious but also simple to prepare, making it a popular choice for both home cooks and restaurant chefs alike </p>
