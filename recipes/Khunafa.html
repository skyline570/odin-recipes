    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>Kunafa, also known as Knafeh, is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert renowned for its crispy, buttery layers of shredded phyllo dough encasing a luscious filling of sweet cheese. Often flavored with rose and orange blossom waters, this dessert is finished with a generous pour of aromatic sugar syrup, giving it a delightful sweetness that complements its rich, cheesy interior. Originating from the Levant region, Kunafa has become a beloved treat across various cultures, celebrated for its unique texture and harmonious blend of flavors.</p>

    <p>The beauty of Kunafa lies in its simplicity and the balance of contrasting textures and flavors. The crispy exterior provides a satisfying crunch, while the gooey, melty cheese filling offers a comforting richness. This dessert is typically enjoyed warm, allowing the cheese to be perfectly stretchy and the syrup to be fully absorbed, enhancing every bite. Whether served during festive occasions or as an indulgent after-dinner treat, Kunafa never fails to impress with its decadence and delightful taste</p>
